This will open the project in Choregraphe for you, and it should be ready to run on your Pepper.

Make sure you are connected to your Pepper, and run the program.

Note that for some exercises, it's best if Autonomous Life (the heart icon) is turned off.


#### Recognising NAOMarks

For this exercise you will need NAOMarks 64 & 68, downloadable from the Aldebaran Documentation [here](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/_downloads/NAOmark.pdf).

After you run this program in Choregraphe, hold up NAOMark 64 or 68 in front of Pepper's camera. Pepper will perform the corresponding action.
